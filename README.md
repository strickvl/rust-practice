# Rust Practice

This repository contains code and markdown files for various books and projects
while I'm learning Rust.

- the `rust-essentials` folder contains the code for the exercises in the book "Rust
Essentials" (2nd ed) by Ivo Balbaert.
- the `command-line-rust` relates to the O'Reilly book 'Command-Line Rust'
